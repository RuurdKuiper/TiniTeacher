              "summary_ELI5": "Plato believed that there is a perfect version of everything called the 'Form'. This is like how a toy car is not as good as the real car, which is the perfect idea of a car.",
              "summary_ELI12": "Plato's Theory of Forms states that non-material abstract forms, and not the material world, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. For example, the Form of Beauty represents the perfect idea of beauty that all beautiful things strive to embody.",
              "summary_ELI16": "Plato's World of Forms posits that the tangible world we experience is a mere shadow of a more real, abstract world where the Forms exist. The Forms are unchanging and perfect ideals, while the physical objects we encounter are imperfect copies of these ideals.",
              "summary_ELI25": "In Plato's metaphysical framework, the World of Forms constitutes a transcendent realm where abstract entities, or 'Forms', exist independently of their physical representations. This bifurcation emphasizes the distinction between the sensory and intelligible realms, asserting that knowledge derived from the senses is inherently flawed compared to the a priori knowledge attainable through intellectual insight into the Forms.",

                    "ELI16": "Forms represent the true essence of concepts, such as the Form of Justice defining what justice truly is.",

                    "ELI25": "Plato's epistemology posits that knowledge derived from the Forms is superior to empirical knowledge, thus advocating for a philosophical methodology that seeks to comprehend these eternal truths."
